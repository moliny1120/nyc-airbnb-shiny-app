# NYC Airbnb Data Visualization (Shiny App)

## Overview
This project is an interactive data visualization application built with **R Shiny** to explore Airbnb listings in New York City.  
Users can adjust **borough**, **price range**, and **room type**, then a dynamic density map and summary tables will display available listings matching user-specified criteria.

The goal of this project is to help users identify target neighborhoods that best match their housing preferences, rather than inspecting the entire NYC map at once.

## Data
- Source: Inside Airbnb (publicly available NYC listings data)
- The dataset includes listing-level information such as location, price, room type, and availability.
- Due to file size constraints, the raw data is not uploaded directly.
